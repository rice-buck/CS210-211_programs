Dealer checklist:

-  Constructor exists X
-  Dealer stores a Hand X
-  Dealer can receive cards via addCard() X
-  Dealer can print its hand X
-  handValue() exists (stub okay) 
-  playTurn(Deck&) is implemented
-  The dealer draws cards in a loop
-  It compiles and runs in main.cpp


Game is complete when:
 Deck is created and shuffled
 Player and Dealer receive cards
 Player can hit or stand
 Dealer plays automatically
 Busts are handled
 Winner is determined
 main.cpp is minimal
 Code is readable and modular
